Detected network intrusions and predicted whether it is bad or good connection using different sklearn Models, Neural Network.
Trained and tested different neural network models, compared their accuracy and scores, preprocessing of data and parameter tuning is done to get better accuracy. Best neural network model gave us 96% of accuracy.

I have considered and predicted this problem with both binary and multiclass classification. 
In multiclass classification I was able to predict all 23 types of intrusion from data set.
