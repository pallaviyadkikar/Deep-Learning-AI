StackOverflow is one of the web portals that is based
on query answering mechanism. It has a lot of data organized on
the basis of tags. Recommending tags is a one of the more
challenging problems in data mining of text. Tagging lets users
explore related content, and is very useful on question answers
sites like Stack Overflow, Stack Exchange sites, Quora, internet
forums, etc. In this project, I tackle the problem of suggesting
tags for StackOverflow website by analyzing the title and body of
the question. In this project we used SVM, KNN, Neural
Network and RNN(LSTM) models for prediction and compare
their performance.
