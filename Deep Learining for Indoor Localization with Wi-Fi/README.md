Detecting users in an indoor environment based on
Wi-Fi signal strength has a wide domain of applications.
This can be used for objectives like locating users in
smart home systems, locating criminals in bounded
regions, obtaining the count of users on an access point
etc. The paper develops an optimized model that could be
deployed in monitoring and tracking devices used for
locating users based on the Wi-Fi signal strength they
receive in their personal devices. Here, we procure data
of signal strengths from various routers, map them to the
userâ€™s location and consider this mapping as a
classification problem. We train a neural network using
the weights obtained by the proposed
